serializeCircuits.js:
Used on first startup to convert Bristol Fashion circuits into a compact
binary format.

gcworker_wasm.js:
Garbler and evaluator which uses garbler.wasm for most operations. We still perform
Salsa20 hashing in JS (because it is more performant than in wasm).

gcworker_purejs.js:
Garbler and evaluator written in pure JS (~5-10x slower than the wasm version).
Not used by default but can serve as a drop-in replacement in cases if wasm
cannot be loaded.

garbler.wasm:
Garbler and evaluator loaded by gcworker_wasm.js. It was compiled from Rust 
into WebAssembly.

src/:
Rust source code for garbler.wasm. Not actually in use by the extenstion. It 
is here just for convenience. 

To compile garbler.wasm from source deterministically:

cd src/
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential
# the official way to install rustup is: 
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup install 1.58.1
rustup +1.58.1 target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain 1.58.1
RUSTFLAGS='-C target-feature=+simd128' cargo +1.58.1 build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
The result in target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/garbler.wasm will be bit 
identical to garbler.wasm
